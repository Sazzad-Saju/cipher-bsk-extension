# Privacy Policy for Cipher-BSK  
**Last updated: 14 Feb, 2025**  

## 1. Introduction  
Cipher-BSK is a lightweight encryption extension that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text securely, based on academic cryptographic techniques. The extension is designed for educational, experimental, and personal security purposes, operating entirely within the user's browser.  

## 2. Data Collection & Storage  
- **No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted.**  
- All encryption and decryption processes occur **locally within the browser session** and are not stored after the session ends.  
- Users may choose to manually store encrypted text externally, but the extension does not manage or control this storage.  

## 3. Use of Third-Party Services  
- Cipher-BSK does **not** use external servers, APIs, or cloud storage.  
- The encryption logic is based on **open-source npm and Composer packages** (cipher-bsk), which are also available for developers to use independently. These packages do not collect or transmit data.  

## 4. Permissions & Access  
- This extension **does not request any permissions** in Chrome.  
- It does not access, modify, or monitor user activities or web content.  

## 5. Security Considerations  
- While the **encrypted text is secure**, the **plain text remains unprotected** before encryption or after decryption. Users should **not share or expose sensitive plaintext**.  
- **Master Password Responsibility:** Users must remember their encryption key (master password) since there is no way to recover lost keys.  
- For added security, users may opt for a **private-key + public-key** mechanism to store or share encryption keys securely.  

## 6. Changes to this Policy  
- Any future updates to this privacy policy will be reflected here.  
- Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically for any changes.
